Developer Case Study: Music Demo Submission Platform
Welcome! We're excited to see what you can build. This case study is designed to simulate a real-world project and give you a chance to showcase your skills in creating a full-featured web application.
The challenge is to build a platform that allows artists to submit their music demos to our label and for our A&R team to review them efficiently.
Time Limit: Please spend no more than 5 hours on this project. We respect your time and are more interested in your approach and the quality of your work within this timeframe than in a perfectly polished, feature-complete application.
Project Goal
Build a robust demo submission platform for a music label. The application should serve two primary user types: artists, who can upload their tracks, and administrators, who can review and manage submissions through a dedicated dashboard.
Core Features
1. Artist Submission Portal
This is the public-facing side where artists will submit their work.
Multi-Track Uploader:
Allow artists to upload multiple tracks (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A) in a single submission.
Implement an asynchronous upload process so artists can fill out their information while files are uploading in the background.
Include a progress tracker and estimated time to completion for the upload.
Validate files for size and format, providing clear error messages.
Artist Information Form:
Collect essential artist details: name, email, and phone number.
Include fields for social media links (e.g., Instagram, SoundCloud, Spotify) and a brief artist biography.
Allow artists to add specific details for each track: title, genre, BPM, key, and a short description.
Confirmation:
After a successful submission, send an automated confirmation email to the artist.
The email should be an HTML template sent from a custom domain (e.g., submissions@yourlabel.com).
2. Admin Review Dashboard
This is the secure, internal-facing side for our team.
Secure Login:
Implement a secure authentication system for administrators.
Submission Management:
Display all submissions in a clean, filterable, and searchable interface.
Allow admins to stream audio directly without needing to download the full file. A waveform visualization would be a great touch.
Manage submission statuses: Pending, In-Review, Approved, Rejected.
Review & Grading System:
Enable admins to grade submissions on a 1-10 scale.
Provide fields for internal notes and constructive feedback for the artist.
Email Template Editor:
Create a simple visual editor within the dashboard for managing HTML email templates (e.g., confirmation, rejection, and approval emails).
Allow the use of dynamic variables (like {{artist_name}}) in the templates.
Technical Requirements
Frontend
Framework: React or Next.js.
Styling: Your preferred modern styling solution.
Design & Aesthetics: This is crucial. The platform must look beautiful and professional, fitting for a modern music label. We want a clean, premium, and visually engaging interface. Pay close attention to typography, spacing, and color palette to create a polished user experience that reflects our brand's commitment to quality.
User Experience: Prioritize intuitive navigation, clear feedback (e.g., for form validation and upload progress), and a smooth user journey.
Backend & Database
API: Design a RESTful API with clear endpoints and consistent error handling.
File Handling:
Use a reliable file storage solution (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary).
Implement background job processing for tasks like metadata extraction or audio compression.
Database:
Choose a database you are comfortable with.
Design a schema that logically connects artists, submissions, tracks, and reviews.
Real-Time Updates: Use WebSockets to provide real-time updates on the admin dashboard as new submissions come in.
Email: Integrate with an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun.
User Experience & Optics
The entire user journey, from an artist landing on the page to an admin reviewing a track, should feel intuitive and seamless.
The application must be fully responsive, providing an excellent experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Prioritize clear feedback for all user actions, such as form validation, upload progress, and status changes. The visual polish and smooth interactions are as important as the functionality.
Deliverables
Git Repository: A link to your complete codebase with a clear commit history. Your README.md should include:
Setup and installation instructions.
Documentation for environment variables.
An overview of your database schema.
Live Deployment: A URL to a working, deployed version of your application on a platform like Vercel or Railway. Please include admin credentials for testing.
Written Documentation (500-1000 words): A brief document explaining:
Your architectural decisions and technical choices.
How you approached the file upload and email systems.
Any trade-offs you made or known limitations.
How you used AI coding assistants in your workflow, with specific examples if possible.
Screen Recording (Optional but Recommended): A short screen recording (a link is fine) where you walk through your development process, demonstrate key features, and explain your problem-solving approach.
Evaluation Criteria
We'll be looking at your submission holistically, with an emphasis on the following:
Technical Implementation (40%): The quality of your code, database design, API structure, and overall architecture.
Feature Completeness (30%): How well the core features listed above are implemented and function.
User Experience (20%): The usability, responsiveness, and design of the application for both artists and admins.
Documentation & Process (10%): The clarity of your documentation and the thought process demonstrated in your work.


When working with LLMs, please make sure to include the exact prompts you used for code generation in your commit messages, alongside the description of your changes.
